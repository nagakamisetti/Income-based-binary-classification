In this project I am trying to classify each person into high or low income category based on census data. This dataset is an example on unbalanced dataset, as one class is higher in proportion to the other class. I would like to also test undersampling and other approaches used in such scenarios in supervised machine learning. 

data : This dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

data source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/

Save the files as csv type for ease of working. There are three files with names adult.data, adult_test.data and names.names. The file names has information about the different fields in the dataset. Authors of teh daatset separated the files into training and testdata. As these files can easily be downloaded from the above mentioned source and to follow the license I am not uploading the data files here.   

Projece Status: This is still in development phase and this repository will be updated on a weekly basis. 

Contributing: After this project is completed, I will update my code and results here and you can continue from my work.
